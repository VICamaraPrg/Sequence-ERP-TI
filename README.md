# SequenceERPTI

This project acts as the technical interview for Sequence-ERP.  

The objective is to make a frontend application using Angular to manage (in my case), songs that artists have and those artists have companies.  

## Mandatory technical requirements:  
-  There's no rush as for the project organization as it can escalate quickly.
- Apply the top performance skills to develop that I can handle.
- Freedom to use any UI component library.
- Implement support for language translation.
- Handle loading states (Spinners, loading bars...).

## Extra requirements (optionals and very valuable)
- Implement state management. Either Redux pattern, BehaviorSubjects, signal stores...
- Testing
  - Unit: [Karma / Jasmine] or Jest
  - Integration: [Karma / Jasmine] or Jest
  - E2E: Playwright or Cypress.
- Use any CSS methodology (BEM, Utility) or TailwindCSS.

## What will I be using?
My implementation will use:

- UI Library: PrimeNg.
- State Management: Signal Stores.
- CSS: TailwindCSS.
- i18n: ngx-translate.
- API: json-server (Since we have a ready mocked json)
- Format: Prettier
- Testing:
  - E2E: Cypress
  - Integration: TBA
  - Unit: TBA
